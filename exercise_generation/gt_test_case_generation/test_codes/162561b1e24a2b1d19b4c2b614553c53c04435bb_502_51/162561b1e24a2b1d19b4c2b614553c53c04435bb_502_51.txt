You are a programming expert your task is to generate 13 unit test cases for the function - tenRun such that the function passes all of the 13 test cases.

Programming Question: For each multiple of 10 in the given array, change all the values following it to be that multiple of 10, until encountering another multiple of 10. So {2, 10, 3, 4, 20, 5} yields {2, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20}.

Code: 
"
public class TenRun
{
    public int[] tenRun(int[] nums)
    {
        int thisTen = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            if (nums[i] % 10 == 0)
            {
                thisTen = nums[i];
            }
            else if (thisTen != -1)
            {
                nums[i] = thisTen;
            }
        }
        
        return nums;
    }   
    
    public void test_tenRun(String[] args)
    {
        // Come up with test cases here
    }
}
"

Hint: Complete the function "public void test_tenRun(String[] args)" with the test cases. Just define the test cases and make calls to tenRun. 

For each test case your output must be as follows: 
System.out.println('test_case_1', tenRun(test_case_1))

The idea is to have all test cases pass the given code.
