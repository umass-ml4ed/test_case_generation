{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it only returns the last n characters of the string once, instead of repeating it n times. Generated Test cases 1-6 (6/11) should pass the buggy code because they have n=1, which means the last character of the string should be repeated once, which is exactly what the buggy code does. The remaining test cases (7-11) should fail the buggy code because they have n>1. In the previous generation, test case 4 and 5 were incorrectly predicted to fail the buggy code. This has been corrected in this generation.", "test_case_1": "\"Hello\", 1", "test_case_2": "\"World\", 1", "test_case_3": "\"Java\", 1", "test_case_4": "\"Programming\", 1", "test_case_5": "\"Test\", 1", "test_case_6": "\"Case\", 1", "test_case_7": "\"Hello\", 2", "test_case_8": "\"World\", 3", "test_case_9": "\"Java\", 2", "test_case_10": "\"Programming\", 4", "test_case_11": "\"Test\", 3"}
