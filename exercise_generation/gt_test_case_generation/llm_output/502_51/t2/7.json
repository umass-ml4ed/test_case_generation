{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it only changes the values to 10, regardless of the multiple of 10 encountered. It also fails to correctly identify multiples of 10 that are not 10 itself. Generated Test cases 1-7 (7/13) should pass the buggy code, while all test cases should pass the perfect code. In the previous test cases, the buggy code failed to pass most of them because they contained multiples of 10 other than 10 itself. To fix this, the new test cases 1-7 only contain the number 10 as a multiple of 10.", "test_case_1": "new int[]{2, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6}", "test_case_2": "new int[]{10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}", "test_case_3": "new int[]{1, 2, 10, 4, 5, 6}", "test_case_4": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 10, 5, 6}", "test_case_5": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 6}", "test_case_6": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10}", "test_case_7": "new int[]{10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5}", "test_case_8": "new int[]{20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15}", "test_case_9": "new int[]{30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25}", "test_case_10": "new int[]{40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35}", "test_case_11": "new int[]{50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45}", "test_case_12": "new int[]{60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55}", "test_case_13": "new int[]{70, 69, 68, 67, 66, 65}"}
