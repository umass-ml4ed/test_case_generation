{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it only checks for 7 in the next index after 6, but the problem statement says that every 6 will be followed by at least one 7, not necessarily immediately after 6. So, the buggy code fails when there are numbers between 6 and 7. In the previous test cases, the buggy code passed more test cases than expected. This was because some test cases had 7 immediately after 6. To correct this, I have modified test cases 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 to include numbers between 6 and 7. Now, generated Test cases 1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 (8/15) should pass the buggy code, and all test cases (15/15) should pass the perfect code.", "test_case_1": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}", "test_case_2": "new int[]{6, 2, 7, 1, 3}", "test_case_3": "new int[]{1, 6, 2, 7, 3}", "test_case_4": "new int[]{1, 2, 6, 3, 7}", "test_case_5": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7}", "test_case_6": "new int[]{6, 1, 7}", "test_case_7": "new int[]{1, 6, 2, 7}", "test_case_8": "new int[]{1, 2, 6, 3, 7}", "test_case_9": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 4}", "test_case_10": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}", "test_case_11": "new int[]{6, 1, 2, 3, 7, 4}", "test_case_12": "new int[]{1, 6, 2, 3, 7, 4}", "test_case_13": "new int[]{1, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4}", "test_case_14": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7}", "test_case_15": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 7}"}
