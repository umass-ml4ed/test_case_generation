{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it does not correctly handle the case where the first number is not equal to the second number but is equal to the third number. In this case, it should return 10, but it returns 0. Generated Test cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (8/12) should pass the buggy code, while test cases 9, 10, 11, 12 (4/12) will fail. In the previous generation, the test cases were not correctly reflecting the bug in the code. The test cases have been modified to correctly reflect the bug.", "test_case_1": "1, 1, 1", "test_case_2": "2, 2, 2", "test_case_3": "3, 3, 3", "test_case_4": "4, 4, 4", "test_case_5": "1, 2, 2", "test_case_6": "2, 3, 3", "test_case_7": "3, 4, 4", "test_case_8": "4, 5, 5", "test_case_9": "1, 2, 1", "test_case_10": "2, 3, 2", "test_case_11": "3, 4, 3", "test_case_12": "4, 5, 4"}
