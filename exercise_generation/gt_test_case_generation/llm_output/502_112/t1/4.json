{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it does not correctly handle the case when n >= 3. It only correctly generates the pattern for n < 3. For n >= 3, it starts overwriting the previously written values in the array, resulting in incorrect output. Generated Test cases 1, 2, 3, 4 (4/7) should pass the buggy code as they have n < 3. Test cases 5, 6, 7 (3/7) should fail the buggy code as they have n >= 3.", "test_case_1": "0", "test_case_2": "1", "test_case_3": "2", "test_case_4": "2", "test_case_5": "3", "test_case_6": "4", "test_case_7": "5"}
