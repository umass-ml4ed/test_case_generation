{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it fails to replace the characters with '+' in the last few characters of the string if the length of the word is greater than 1. This is because of the condition 'i >= str.length() - word.length()'. Generated Test cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 should pass the buggy code as they either have a word of length 1 or the word is not present in the last few characters of the string. Test cases 9, 10, 11 should fail the buggy code as the word is present in the last few characters of the string. In the previous generation, test cases 7 and 8 were incorrectly predicted to pass the buggy code. These have been modified in this generation to ensure they pass the buggy code.", "test_case_1": "\"Hello World\", \"o\"", "test_case_2": "\"Hello World\", \"H\"", "test_case_3": "\"Hello World\", \"d\"", "test_case_4": "\"Hello World\", \" \"", "test_case_5": "\"Hello World\", \"l\"", "test_case_6": "\"Hello World\", \"W\"", "test_case_7": "\"Hello\", \"o\"", "test_case_8": "\"World\", \"d\"", "test_case_9": "\"Hello World\", \"ld\"", "test_case_10": "\"Hello World\", \"orld\"", "test_case_11": "\"Hello World\", \"World\""}
