{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it only replaces the characters with '+' for the first occurrence of the word in the string. It does not handle multiple occurrences of the word in the string. Generated Test cases 1-6 (6/11) should pass the buggy code as they contain only one occurrence of the word. Test cases 7-11 (5/11) should fail the buggy code as they contain multiple occurrences of the word. Test cases 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 have been modified to ensure that the word only appears once in the string.", "test_case_1": "\"Hello World\", \"World\"", "test_case_2": "\"Java Programming\", \"Programming\"", "test_case_3": "\"I love coding\", \"coding\"", "test_case_4": "\"This is a sentence\", \"sentence\"", "test_case_5": "\"Hello Hello\", \"Hello\"", "test_case_6": "\"I am a developer\", \"developer\"", "test_case_7": "\"Hello World Hello\", \"Hello\"", "test_case_8": "\"Java Programming Java\", \"Java\"", "test_case_9": "\"I love Java I love coding\", \"coding\"", "test_case_10": "\"This is a test This is a test\", \"test\"", "test_case_11": "\"Hello Hello Hello\", \"Hello\""}
