{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it returns false when it is the weekend and the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The perfect code correctly checks if it is the weekend and if the number of cigars is greater than or equal to 40. Generated Test cases 1-8 should pass the buggy code, while all 13 test cases should pass the perfect code. In the previous generation, test cases 9-13 were not passing the buggy code as expected. Therefore, in this generation, the number of cigars for test cases 9-13 has been increased to be more than 60.", "test_case_1": "50, false", "test_case_2": "40, false", "test_case_3": "60, false", "test_case_4": "45, false", "test_case_5": "55, false", "test_case_6": "35, false", "test_case_7": "65, false", "test_case_8": "70, false", "test_case_9": "65, true", "test_case_10": "70, true", "test_case_11": "80, true", "test_case_12": "100, true", "test_case_13": "75, true"}
