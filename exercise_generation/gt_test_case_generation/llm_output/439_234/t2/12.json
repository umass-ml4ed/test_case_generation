{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it does not consider the upper limit of cigars during weekdays. It only checks if the number of cigars is greater than or equal to 40, regardless of whether it is a weekend or not. This is incorrect as per the problem statement, which specifies that during weekdays, the number of cigars should be between 40 and 60, inclusive. Generated Test cases 1-12 (12/13) should pass the buggy code, while all 13 test cases should pass the perfect code. In the previous generation, test case 5 was incorrect because the number of cigars was above 60 and it was not a weekend. This test case has been modified in this generation.", "test_case_1": "50, false", "test_case_2": "40, false", "test_case_3": "60, false", "test_case_4": "30, false", "test_case_5": "59, false", "test_case_6": "50, true", "test_case_7": "40, true", "test_case_8": "60, true", "test_case_9": "30, true", "test_case_10": "70, true", "test_case_11": "80, true", "test_case_12": "90, true", "test_case_13": "61, false"}
