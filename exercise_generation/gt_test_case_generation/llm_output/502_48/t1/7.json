{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it does not correctly handle the case where the array contains 10's. It sets the 10's to 0 but does not shift the remaining elements to the left. Also, it does not set the empty spaces at the end of the array to 0. Generated Test cases 1-7 should pass the buggy code because they do not contain 10's. Test cases 8-11 should fail the buggy code because they contain 10's.", "test_case_1": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}", "test_case_2": "new int[]{6, 7, 8, 9, 0}", "test_case_3": "new int[]{11, 12, 13, 14, 15}", "test_case_4": "new int[]{16, 17, 18, 19, 20}", "test_case_5": "new int[]{21, 22, 23, 24, 25}", "test_case_6": "new int[]{26, 27, 28, 29, 30}", "test_case_7": "new int[]{31, 32, 33, 34, 35}", "test_case_8": "new int[]{1, 10, 2, 10, 3}", "test_case_9": "new int[]{10, 10, 10, 10, 10}", "test_case_10": "new int[]{10, 2, 10, 3, 10}", "test_case_11": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 10, 10}"}
