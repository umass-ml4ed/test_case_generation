{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is due to the lack of braces in the if conditions. This causes the swapping of variables to always occur, regardless of the condition. Generated Test cases 1-13 (13/21) should pass the buggy code, as they are designed in a way that the swapping of variables doesn't affect the result. Test cases 14-21 (8/21) should fail the buggy code, as they are designed in a way that the incorrect swapping of variables leads to a wrong result. In the previous generation, the test cases were not correctly designed to expose the bug. In this generation, the test cases have been modified to correctly expose the bug.", "test_case_1": "1, 2, 3", "test_case_2": "2, 4, 6", "test_case_3": "3, 6, 9", "test_case_4": "4, 8, 12", "test_case_5": "5, 10, 15", "test_case_6": "6, 12, 18", "test_case_7": "7, 14, 21", "test_case_8": "8, 16, 24", "test_case_9": "9, 18, 27", "test_case_10": "10, 20, 30", "test_case_11": "11, 22, 33", "test_case_12": "12, 24, 36", "test_case_13": "13, 26, 39", "test_case_14": "1, 3, 2", "test_case_15": "2, 4, 3", "test_case_16": "3, 5, 4", "test_case_17": "4, 6, 5", "test_case_18": "5, 7, 6", "test_case_19": "6, 8, 7", "test_case_20": "7, 9, 8", "test_case_21": "8, 10, 9"}
