{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it does not correctly populate the ending array. The variable 'beginning' is always reset to 0 in each iteration of the loop, so only the first element of the ending array is ever set. Generated Test cases 1-12 should pass the buggy code as they have n=0 or n=nums.length or the first and last n elements are the same. Test cases 13-16 should fail the buggy code as the first and last n elements are different.", "test_case_1": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 0", "test_case_2": "new int[]{6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, 5", "test_case_3": "new int[]{11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}, 5", "test_case_4": "new int[]{16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}, 10", "test_case_5": "new int[]{21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25}, 0", "test_case_6": "new int[]{26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30}, 10", "test_case_7": "new int[]{31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35}, 5", "test_case_8": "new int[]{36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40}, 10", "test_case_9": "new int[]{41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45}, 0", "test_case_10": "new int[]{46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50}, 10", "test_case_11": "new int[]{51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55}, 5", "test_case_12": "new int[]{56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60}, 10", "test_case_13": "new int[]{61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70}, 5", "test_case_14": "new int[]{71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80}, 5", "test_case_15": "new int[]{81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90}, 5", "test_case_16": "new int[]{91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100}, 5"}
