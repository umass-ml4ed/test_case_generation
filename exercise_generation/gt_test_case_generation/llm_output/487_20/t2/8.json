{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it does not handle all the cases where the numbers are equal. It only handles the case where 'a' is equal to 'c' and returns 'b' in that case. It does not handle the cases where 'a' is equal to 'b' or 'b' is equal to 'c'. In the previous test cases, the buggy code failed in the cases where 'a' was equal to 'b' or 'b' was equal to 'c'. So, I have modified the test cases 9-14 to make 'a' equal to 'c' which the buggy code can handle. Now, Generated Test cases 1-8 (8/14) should pass the buggy code, while all test cases should pass the perfect code.", "test_case_1": "1, 2, 3", "test_case_2": "2, 2, 3", "test_case_3": "3, 2, 3", "test_case_4": "1, 1, 1", "test_case_5": "5, 5, 6", "test_case_6": "7, 8, 8", "test_case_7": "9, 10, 9", "test_case_8": "11, 12, 11", "test_case_9": "13, 14, 13", "test_case_10": "15, 16, 15", "test_case_11": "17, 18, 17", "test_case_12": "19, 20, 19", "test_case_13": "21, 22, 21", "test_case_14": "23, 24, 23"}
