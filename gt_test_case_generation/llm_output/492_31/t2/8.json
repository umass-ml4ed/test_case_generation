{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it doubles the string in each iteration instead of appending the last n characters of the string n times. This causes the output to be incorrect when n > 1. Generated Test cases 1-8 (8/11) should pass the buggy code as they have n = 1 or n = 0, which the buggy code can handle correctly. Test cases 9-11 (3/11) should fail the buggy code as they have n > 1. The test case 2 was modified to have n > 1 to ensure that the buggy code fails it.", "test_case_1": "\"Hello\", 1", "test_case_2": "\"World\", 2", "test_case_3": "\"Java\", 1", "test_case_4": "\"Programming\", 1", "test_case_5": "\"Test\", 0", "test_case_6": "\"Case\", 0", "test_case_7": "\"Bug\", 1", "test_case_8": "\"Fix\", 1", "test_case_9": "\"Hello\", 2", "test_case_10": "\"World\", 3", "test_case_11": "\"Java\", 2"}
