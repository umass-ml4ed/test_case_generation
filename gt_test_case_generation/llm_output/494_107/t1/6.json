{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it counts every pair of same adjacent numbers as a clump, while a clump is defined as a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value. So, if there are more than 2 same adjacent numbers, it should be counted as one clump, not multiple. Generated Test cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (6/11) should pass the buggy code, as they contain no or only pairs of same adjacent numbers. The other test cases contain more than 2 same adjacent numbers, which should be counted as one clump, but the buggy code counts them as multiple.", "test_case_1": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}", "test_case_2": "new int[]{1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}", "test_case_3": "new int[]{1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5}", "test_case_4": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5}", "test_case_5": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5}", "test_case_6": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5}", "test_case_7": "new int[]{1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4}", "test_case_8": "new int[]{1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4}", "test_case_9": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4}", "test_case_10": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4}", "test_case_11": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5}"}
