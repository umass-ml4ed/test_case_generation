{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it only checks for the first occurrence of 'xyz' in the string. If the first occurrence of 'xyz' is preceded by a period, it will return false even if there are other occurrences of 'xyz' not preceded by a period. Generated Test cases 1-14 should pass the buggy code as they contain only one occurrence of 'xyz' or the first occurrence is not preceded by a period. Test case 15 should fail the buggy code as the first occurrence of 'xyz' is preceded by a period but there is another occurrence not preceded by a period.", "test_case_1": "\"xyz\"", "test_case_2": "\"axyz\"", "test_case_3": "\".xyz\"", "test_case_4": "\"xyzxyz\"", "test_case_5": "\".xyzxyz\"", "test_case_6": "\"axyzxyz\"", "test_case_7": "\"xyzaxyz\"", "test_case_8": "\".xyzaxyz\"", "test_case_9": "\"axyz.axyz\"", "test_case_10": "\".xyz.axyz\"", "test_case_11": "\"axyz.axyz.axyz\"", "test_case_12": "\".xyz.axyz.axyz\"", "test_case_13": "\"axyz.axyz.axyz.axyz\"", "test_case_14": "\".xyz.axyz.axyz.axyz\"", "test_case_15": "\".xyzaxyz\""}
