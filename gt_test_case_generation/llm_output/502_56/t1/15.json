{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is in the sorting algorithm. The code is trying to sort the array in ascending order but the inner loop starts from the outer loop index which causes the array to be partially sorted. This results in incorrect calculation of the centered average as the smallest and largest values are not correctly identified. Generated Test cases 1-15 should pass the buggy code as they are designed in a way that the smallest and largest values are already at the ends of the array. Test cases 16-21 should fail the buggy code as they are designed in a way that the smallest and largest values are not at the ends of the array.", "test_case_1": "new int[]{1, 2, 3}", "test_case_2": "new int[]{4, 5, 6, 7}", "test_case_3": "new int[]{8, 9, 10, 11, 12}", "test_case_4": "new int[]{13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}", "test_case_5": "new int[]{19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25}", "test_case_6": "new int[]{26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33}", "test_case_7": "new int[]{34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42}", "test_case_8": "new int[]{43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52}", "test_case_9": "new int[]{53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63}", "test_case_10": "new int[]{64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75}", "test_case_11": "new int[]{76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88}", "test_case_12": "new int[]{89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102}", "test_case_13": "new int[]{103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117}", "test_case_14": "new int[]{118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133}", "test_case_15": "new int[]{134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150}", "test_case_16": "new int[]{2, 1, 3}", "test_case_17": "new int[]{5, 4, 6, 7}", "test_case_18": "new int[]{10, 8, 9, 11, 12}", "test_case_19": "new int[]{16, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18}", "test_case_20": "new int[]{22, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25}", "test_case_21": "new int[]{29, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33}"}
