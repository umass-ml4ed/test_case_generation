{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it only adds to the sum and increments the count if the number is not the smallest or largest. This means that if there are multiple copies of the smallest or largest number, it will ignore all of them, not just one. Generated Test cases 1-11 (11/21) should pass the buggy code as they have unique smallest and largest values. Test cases 12-21 (10/21) should fail the buggy code as they have multiple copies of the smallest or largest values. The test cases have been modified to ensure that the smallest and largest values are unique in the first 11 test cases and repeated in the last 10 test cases.", "test_case_1": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4}", "test_case_2": "new int[]{5, 6, 7, 8}", "test_case_3": "new int[]{9, 10, 11, 12}", "test_case_4": "new int[]{13, 14, 15, 16}", "test_case_5": "new int[]{17, 18, 19, 20}", "test_case_6": "new int[]{21, 22, 23, 24}", "test_case_7": "new int[]{25, 26, 27, 28}", "test_case_8": "new int[]{29, 30, 31, 32}", "test_case_9": "new int[]{33, 34, 35, 36}", "test_case_10": "new int[]{37, 38, 39, 40}", "test_case_11": "new int[]{41, 42, 43, 44}", "test_case_12": "new int[]{1, 2, 2, 3, 4}", "test_case_13": "new int[]{5, 6, 6, 7, 8}", "test_case_14": "new int[]{9, 10, 10, 11, 12}", "test_case_15": "new int[]{13, 14, 14, 15, 16}", "test_case_16": "new int[]{17, 18, 18, 19, 20}", "test_case_17": "new int[]{21, 22, 22, 23, 24}", "test_case_18": "new int[]{25, 26, 26, 27, 28}", "test_case_19": "new int[]{29, 30, 30, 31, 32}", "test_case_20": "new int[]{33, 34, 34, 35, 36}", "test_case_21": "new int[]{37, 38, 38, 39, 40}"}
