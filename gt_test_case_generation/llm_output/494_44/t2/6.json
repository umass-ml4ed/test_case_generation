{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it returns the first even number it encounters in the array instead of counting the total number of even numbers. Generated Test cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (6/10) should pass the buggy code because they contain only one even number at the end of the array. The remaining test cases 7, 8, 9, 10 (4/10) should fail the buggy code because they contain more than one even number.", "test_case_1": "new int[]{1, 3, 5, 7, 2}", "test_case_2": "new int[]{11, 13, 15, 17, 4}", "test_case_3": "new int[]{21, 23, 25, 27, 6}", "test_case_4": "new int[]{31, 33, 35, 37, 8}", "test_case_5": "new int[]{41, 43, 45, 47, 10}", "test_case_6": "new int[]{51, 53, 55, 57, 12}", "test_case_7": "new int[]{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}", "test_case_8": "new int[]{12, 14, 16, 18, 20}", "test_case_9": "new int[]{22, 24, 26, 28, 30}", "test_case_10": "new int[]{32, 34, 36, 38, 40}"}
