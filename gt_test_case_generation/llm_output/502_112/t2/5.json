{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it only works for n <= 4. It does not generate the correct array for n > 4. Generated Test cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 should pass the buggy code as they have n <= 4. Test cases 6 and 7 should fail the buggy code as they have n > 4. In the previous generation, the test cases were not correctly predicted. The buggy code does not handle the case when n = 0 correctly. Therefore, test case 1 has been changed from 0 to 4.", "test_case_1": "4", "test_case_2": "1", "test_case_3": "2", "test_case_4": "3", "test_case_5": "4", "test_case_6": "5", "test_case_7": "6"}
