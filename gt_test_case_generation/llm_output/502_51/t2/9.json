{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it does not handle the case when the first element of the array is not a multiple of 10. In such cases, it incorrectly assigns the first element to all the elements until it encounters a multiple of 10. Generated Test cases 1-9 (9/13) should pass the buggy code, while test cases 10-13 (4/13) should fail. The previous test cases were not correctly formatted as Java code, so they have been corrected in this generation.", "test_case_1": "new int[]{10, 3, 4, 20, 5}", "test_case_2": "new int[]{20, 2, 3, 10, 5}", "test_case_3": "new int[]{30, 4, 5, 6, 7}", "test_case_4": "new int[]{40, 8, 9, 10, 11}", "test_case_5": "new int[]{50, 12, 13, 14, 15}", "test_case_6": "new int[]{60, 16, 17, 18, 19}", "test_case_7": "new int[]{70, 20, 21, 22, 23}", "test_case_8": "new int[]{80, 24, 25, 26, 27}", "test_case_9": "new int[]{90, 28, 29, 30, 31}", "test_case_10": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 5, 20, 6, 7}", "test_case_11": "new int[]{2, 3, 4, 20, 5, 6, 30, 7, 8}", "test_case_12": "new int[]{3, 4, 5, 30, 6, 7, 40, 8, 9}", "test_case_13": "new int[]{4, 5, 6, 40, 7, 8, 50, 9, 10}"}
