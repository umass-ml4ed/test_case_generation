{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it incorrectly checks the number of cigars during the weekend. According to the problem statement, there is no upper bound on the number of cigars during the weekend, but the buggy code checks if the number of cigars is less than 60 even on weekends. Therefore, test cases where the number of cigars is 60 or more and it is the weekend will fail in the buggy code. Generated Test cases 1-10 (10/13) should pass the buggy code, and test cases 11-13 (3/13) should fail the buggy code.", "test_case_1": "40, false", "test_case_2": "50, false", "test_case_3": "60, false", "test_case_4": "30, false", "test_case_5": "70, false", "test_case_6": "40, true", "test_case_7": "50, true", "test_case_8": "59, true", "test_case_9": "39, true", "test_case_10": "61, false", "test_case_11": "60, true", "test_case_12": "70, true", "test_case_13": "100, true"}
