{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it does not handle the case when the input array is empty. In such a case, it tries to access the first element of the array which leads to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Generated Test cases 1-10 should pass the buggy code as they all have non-empty arrays. Test case 11 should fail the buggy code as it has an empty array. The previous test cases were not formatted correctly, they were not valid Java code. The new test cases are valid Java code.", "test_case_1": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}", "test_case_2": "new int[]{6, 7, 8, 9, 10}", "test_case_3": "new int[]{11, 12, 13, 14, 15}", "test_case_4": "new int[]{16, 17, 18, 19, 20}", "test_case_5": "new int[]{21, 22, 23, 24, 25}", "test_case_6": "new int[]{26, 27, 28, 29, 30}", "test_case_7": "new int[]{31, 32, 33, 34, 35}", "test_case_8": "new int[]{36, 37, 38, 39, 40}", "test_case_9": "new int[]{41, 42, 43, 44, 45}", "test_case_10": "new int[]{46, 47, 48, 49, 50}", "test_case_11": "new int[]{}"}
