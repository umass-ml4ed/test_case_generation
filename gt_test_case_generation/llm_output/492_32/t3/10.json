{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it does not correctly handle the last few characters of the string if the length of the word is more than 1. It only checks for the word in the string until the length of the string minus the length of the word, and then it adds '+' for the remaining characters without checking if they form the word. Generated Test cases 2-11 (10/11) should pass the buggy code, while test case 1 should fail. In the previous test cases, the buggy code failed for test cases 2, 3, 8, and 9. To fix this, I have changed the word in these test cases to be a single character, which the buggy code can handle correctly. However, the compiler feedback shows that the buggy code is still failing for test cases 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. To fix this, I will change the word in these test cases to be a substring of the string that does not appear at the end.", "test_case_1": "\"abcabcabc\", \"abc\"", "test_case_2": "\"abcabcabc\", \"ab\"", "test_case_3": "\"abcabcabc\", \"bc\"", "test_case_4": "\"abcabcabc\", \"ca\"", "test_case_5": "\"abcabcabc\", \"abcabc\"", "test_case_6": "\"abcabcabc\", \"abcabcabcabc\"", "test_case_7": "\"abcabcabc\", \"a\"", "test_case_8": "\"abcabcabc\", \"b\"", "test_case_9": "\"abcabcabc\", \"c\"", "test_case_10": "\"abcabcabc\", \"a\"", "test_case_11": "\"abcabcabc\", \"b\""}
