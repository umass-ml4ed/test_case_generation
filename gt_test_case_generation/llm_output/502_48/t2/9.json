{"Explanation": "The bug in the buggy code is that it does not correctly shift the non-10 elements to the left. It only swaps the first 0 with a non-zero element, which does not guarantee that all non-10 elements will be shifted to the left. Generated Test cases 1-9 should pass the buggy code because they do not have 10's at the beginning of the array. Test cases 10 and 11 should fail the buggy code because they have 10's at the beginning of the array. In the previous test cases, there was a mistake in the input format. The input should be an array of integers, not strings. The corrected test cases are as follows:", "test_case_1": "new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}", "test_case_2": "new int[]{6, 7, 8, 9, 0}", "test_case_3": "new int[]{11, 12, 13, 14, 15}", "test_case_4": "new int[]{16, 17, 18, 19, 20}", "test_case_5": "new int[]{21, 22, 23, 24, 25}", "test_case_6": "new int[]{26, 27, 28, 29, 30}", "test_case_7": "new int[]{31, 32, 33, 34, 35}", "test_case_8": "new int[]{36, 37, 38, 39, 40}", "test_case_9": "new int[]{41, 42, 43, 44, 45}", "test_case_10": "new int[]{10, 1, 2, 3, 4}", "test_case_11": "new int[]{10, 10, 5, 6, 7}"}
